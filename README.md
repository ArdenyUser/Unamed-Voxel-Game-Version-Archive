# Unamed-Voxel-Game-Version-Archive
A small project I am working on.

PTV is the PrototypeVersions, very old versions!
DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

PTV = prototypes

PM = premultiplayer builds

PM-SD = premultiplayer survival development builds

MD-SD = multiplayer development and survival development

Pre-Alpha = before alpha

Alpha = early builds

Beta = Getting close to the final release.

Omega = The border between Beta and Release.

Release = first massive and polished release.

PR (or just the normal versions) = Post Release versions.
